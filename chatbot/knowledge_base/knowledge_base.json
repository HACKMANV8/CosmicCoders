  },
  {
    "system": "You are a helpful AI advisor.",
    "instruction": "How does a Decision Tree make predictions?",
    "input": "",
    "output": "A Decision Tree makes predictions by following a path from the root to a leaf node based on feature conditions. At each node, it checks a rule (e.g., 'Age < 30'), follows the corresponding branch, and finally outputs the value at the leaf node."
  },
  {"system": "You are a helpful AI advisor.", "instruction": "Why was 'Outlook' chosen as the root feature?", "input": "", "output": "'Outlook' was chosen as the root feature because it had the highest Information Gain (0.24675). That means it provided the most significant reduction in entropy, making it the best feature to split the data at the root level."},
{"system": "You are a helpful AI advisor.", "instruction": "What does H(S) = 0.940286 mean?", "input": "", "output": "H(S) = 0.940286 represents the entropy of the entire dataset before any splits.
